I have implemented the given task in two ways, the details are as follows : 
  **1)Basic-html:**
  
  The given task was implemented using HTML5, CSS3
  
  
  **2)next-app:**

  Here I have used Nextjs 13.4.16 with App Router.
  I have used next/image component to optimise the image which decreases the size of the image from 1.1MB to 133KB, which will affect the LCP and improve SEO performance.

  Follow the steps to run the next-app:
  1)Go to next-app directory
  2)Run the command to install dev dependencies
      "yarn"
  3)Run the command to run the development server
      "yarn dev"
